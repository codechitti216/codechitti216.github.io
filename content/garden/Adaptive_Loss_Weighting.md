# Fundamental Issues in Multi-Task Learning

## What is MTL?

Consider human perception while driving in traffic. We perform multiple tasks simultaneously—object detection, obstacle avoidance, depth estimation, and planning, among others.

Mimicking this ability in a single architecture or model that learns multiple tasks concurrently is known as **multi-task learning (MTL)**.

## How is MTL Enabled?

Learning is typically associated with minimizing error. Multi-task learning is enabled by optimizing multiple loss functions simultaneously.

The total loss that is backpropagated is usually a linear combination of the individual task losses.

Weights assigned to each task loss are often static (either equal or unequal), but rarely dynamic. Some research has explored **adaptive weighting strategies** to adjust loss contributions during training.

## Task Complexity

Tasks can vary greatly in complexity—for example, surface normal estimation is more complex than a simple regression task.

Updating the model weights based on errors from both complex and simple tasks *without normalization* can mislead training. The **GradNorm** method addresses this issue by balancing gradient magnitudes across tasks.

## Model Capacity

Training a model aims to find the optimal set of weights that capture patterns in the data through the lens of the loss functions.

Using static loss weights during training is analogous to telling a student to "just do your best" without guidance.

My intention is not to passively hope the model optimizes all tasks equally, but to enable it to *analyze* the evolution of each loss over epochs and dynamically prioritize slow-learning or hard tasks.

While this idea shares conceptual similarities with GradNorm, the intentions differ:

- **GradNorm** aims to balance the influence of all losses on the model weights.
- **My approach** seeks to make the model more analytical and *aggressive* in learning by prioritizing difficult tasks dynamically.
