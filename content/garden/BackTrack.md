# Visual Navigation Fails When Localization Breaks

Visual navigation models typically assume one of two extremes: either persistent localization (via GPS, SLAM, or VIO), or no localization at all with only a goal image provided. Both are brittle abstractions in real-world settings.

Autonomous agents operating over long trajectories often experience **localization failures mid-execution**—due to perceptual drift, occlusion, or sensor corruption. In such cases, most learned policies have no recourse: the agent continues blindly, unable to retrace or reorient.

# Backtrack: The Core Idea

We introduce **Backtrack**, a diffusion-based policy model trained to reverse trajectories using only first-person visual input and a keyframe from the last reliable pose.

Given the agent’s current view and a stored visual reference of the last localized state, Backtrack generates an action sequence that navigates *backward*—returning the agent to the known-safe state without any external localization, odometry, or map.

This is not relocalization. This is **learned visual recovery**.

> Just a hunch for now—still need to do the full literature survey, experiments, and ablations. But this feels like a missing capability in current visual navigation stacks. We’ll know soon enough.

# A New Benchmark: Recovery from Drift

We propose a new task: **Recovery-from-Drift**. An agent is executing a planned trajectory using localization, then loses its pose estimation after N steps. The goal is to return to the last reliable pose using visual memory only.

We evaluate Backtrack in AI2-THOR and Habitat environments, showing it outperforms:
- Naïve dead-reckoning with control history
- Relocalization + replanning baselines
- Feedforward goal-conditioned policies (ViNT, NoMaD)

Backtrack consistently succeeds in visual return where other methods stall, drift, or fail entirely.

# Why ViNT and NoMaD Break

ViNT and NoMaD represent the state of the art in visual navigation—but only under idealized forward-conditioned assumptions.

- **ViNT** assumes a known goal image and requires stable conditioning throughout. It cannot self-correct once drifted.
- **NoMaD** uses trajectory-level diffusion priors, but only in the *forward* direction. It is trained to denoise actions toward static goals, not reverse or recover from unseen deviations.

Neither model is equipped to return to a prior state. Neither has any mechanism for **rollback**. In failure cases, they behave like open-loop systems.

**Backtrack fills this gap.** By training on reversed trajectories and conditioning on past frames, it introduces a critical capability: *visual self-correction* under localization loss.

# Visual Navigation Needs Recovery, Not Just Reachability

In safety-critical or long-horizon deployments—underwater, planetary, remote—navigation is not just about reaching a goal. It’s about surviving partial failure.

Backtrack is a step toward autonomy that can **undo its own mistakes**, **recover internal consistency**, and **resume execution safely** without relying on brittle localization pipelines.

This isn’t a detour—it’s the resilience layer today's navigation stacks lack.
