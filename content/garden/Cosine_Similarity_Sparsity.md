# Background / Motivation

This research was inspired by insights from my learning journal entry: **[Understanding Embeddings](/garden/Vector_Embeddings)**

## Key Insights from Learning Journal

While exploring embeddings, I identified a potential flaw in cosine similarity:

> "Cosine similarity may fail when embeddings have zeros across some dimensions, even if they share strong alignment in others."

This observation suggests that standard cosine similarity might not be robust when dealing with sparse embeddings, which are common in practice.

## Research Question

**Hypothesis**: Embedding similarity measured via cosine degrades when sparse (zero-heavy) dimensions are present, and a reweighting or alternative metric (e.g., adjusted cosine with masking) restores alignment fidelity.

## Experiment Design

### Synthetic Data Generation
1. Create pairs of synthetic vectors with controlled sparsity patterns
2. Define ground-truth semantic alignment scores
3. Vary sparsity levels systematically (0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, 90%)

### Comparison Metrics
1. **Standard cosine similarity**
2. **Masked cosine** (ignore zero dimensions)
3. **Learned scaling** (learn optimal weights per dimension)

### Evaluation
- Spearman correlation between similarity score and ground-truth alignment
- Analysis under different sparsity regimes

## Expected Outcomes

Masked cosine similarity should maintain higher correlation with ground-truth alignment compared to standard cosine when sparsity is present.
