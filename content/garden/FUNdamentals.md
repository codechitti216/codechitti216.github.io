## What is this? 

This will be my log of reading, writing, understanding and re-learning Deep Learning from the first principles with reference to the <a href="https://d2l.ai/" style="color:red;">D2L book</a> by <a href="https://www.astonzhang.com/" style="color:red;">Dr. Aston Zhang</a>

The "About this book" section looks very promising. They claim to teach us the concepts, the context and the code! Thats just perfect!
