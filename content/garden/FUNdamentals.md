## What is this? 

This will be my log of reading, writing, understanding and re-learning Deep Learning from the first principles with reference to the [D2L book](https://d2l.ai/) by [Dr. Aston Zhang](https://https://www.astonzhang.com/)

The "About this book" section looks very promising. They claim to teach us the concepts, the context and the code! Thats just perfect!
