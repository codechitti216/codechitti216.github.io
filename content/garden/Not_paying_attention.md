# Where is attention usually used? 

In most architectures, attention mechanisms are typically applied after feature extraction by the encoder to enrich the feature representations or within the decoder to gain a deeper understanding of the output sequence.

Christine Marie Evert, one of tennis’s all-time legends, once said: “To me, consistency is the essence of tennis technique. It’s not about hitting winners... it’s about making fewer mistakes.”

This insight reflects how peak performance often comes from focusing intensely on minimizing errors rather than solely maximizing success.

Inspired by this, I hypothesize that incorporating a small attention layer directly into the loss calculation stage could significantly improve the training process—making it faster, more effective, and more efficient.

This is still a working hypothesis. I plan to formalize this idea, design a rigorous experimental setup, and explore its potential.
