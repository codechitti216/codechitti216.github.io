# Problem & Purpose (structured metadata)
problem_summary: "Learn and implement a simple, local simulation of distributed infrastructure health monitoring and automated remediation — demonstrating the Detect → Plan → Act → Verify loop."
primary_audience: "Anyone curious about agentic systems, especially engineers interested in self-healing infrastructure."
why_now: "Agentic, self-healing patterns are becoming common in large-scale systems. I want to understand these concepts by building a functioning (but small-scale) version from scratch, without cloud costs."
success_metrics:
  - "A few local 'nodes' exchanging telemetry and commands"
  - "Basic failure detection and automated remediation"
  - "Incidents recorded in a database"
  - "A working demo that runs on my laptop"

# Initial Scope & Architecture (v1 goal)
scope_v1:
  - "Python node agents and a basic control plane"
  - "Local database for storing incidents (PostgreSQL via Docker)"
  - "Simple REST APIs for telemetry and commands"
  - "Failure simulation: CPU spike, fake network delay, storage latency"
  - "Single-machine execution only"
out_of_scope_v1:
  - "Cloud deployment"
  - "Running on real hardware nodes"
  - "Full authentication/security layers"
  - "Machine learning-only reasoning (LLM meta-agent is a later stretch goal)"
smallest_demoable_unit: "One agent sends CPU metric → control plane detects high usage → control plane tells agent to restart service → incident is logged."

# Technical depth overview
logic_type: "Starts procedural (if CPU > X → restart). Later, add reasoning and planning with an LLM meta-agent."
simulation_realism: "Synthetic but realistic-enough metrics to test detection and response. OATS will generate varied failure scenarios."
vendor_alignment: "Loosely inspired by how big vendors (e.g., Oracle OCI) do agent → control plane → remediation loops."
performance_needs: "Near-real-time within a few seconds — enough to see events happen live."

# Deliverables (learning goals)
deliverables:ui9l-;[=
\4l. ]
  - "A working Python simulation of agents + control plane"
  - "Local PostgreSQL setup via Docker"
  - "Simple REST endpoints"
  - "Failure simulation scripts"
  - "Step-by-step runbook so anyone can follow along"
