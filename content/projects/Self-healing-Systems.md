# Problem & Purpose (structured metadata)
problem_summary: "Learn and implement a simple, local simulation of distributed infrastructure health monitoring and automated remediation — demonstrating the Detect → Plan → Act → Verify loop."
primary_audience: "Anyone curious about agentic systems, especially engineers interested in self-healing infrastructure."
why_now: "Agentic, self-healing patterns are becoming common in large-scale systems. I want to understand these concepts by building a functioning (but small-scale) version from scratch, without cloud costs."
success_metrics:
  - "A few local 'nodes' exchanging telemetry and commands"
  - "Basic failure detection and automated remediation"
  - "Incidents recorded in a database"
  - "A working demo that runs on my laptop"

# Initial Scope & Architecture (v1 goal)
scope_v1:
  - "Python node agents and a basic control plane"
  - "Local database for storing incidents (PostgreSQL via Docker)"
  - "Simple REST APIs for telemetry and commands"
  - "Failure simulation: CPU spike, fake network delay, storage latency"
  - "Single-machine execution only"
out_of_scope_v1:
  - "Cloud deployment"
  - "Running on real hardware nodes"
  - "Full authentication/security layers"
  - "Machine learning-only reasoning (LLM meta-agent is a later stretch goal)"
smallest_demoable_unit: "One agent sends CPU metric → control plane detects high usage → control plane tells agent to restart service → incident is logged."

# Technical depth overview
logic_type: "Starts procedural (if CPU > X → restart). Later, add reasoning and planning with an LLM meta-agent."
simulation_realism: "Synthetic but realistic-enough metrics to test detection and response. OATS will generate varied failure scenarios."
vendor_alignment: "Loosely inspired by how big vendors (e.g., Oracle OCI) do agent → control plane → remediation loops."
performance_needs: "Near-real-time within a few seconds — enough to see events happen live."

# Deliverables (learning goals)

  - "A working Python simulation of agents + control plane"
  - "Local PostgreSQL setup via Docker"
  - "Simple REST endpoints"
  - "Failure simulation scripts"
  - "Step-by-step runbook so anyone can follow along"

# Learning Context

**Motivation.**  
This is my first hands-on project in this domain. I’m new to cloud infrastructure, databases, Docker, APIs — all of it. I’m using this project to learn those skills in a focused, applied way, with AI tools helping me understand and implement each piece.

**Approach.**  
Instead of reading theory endlessly, I’m building a minimal working system and expanding it in small, understandable steps. Each step will be documented — both the working code and what I learned.

# Problem & Purpose

I want to **simulate how self-healing systems work** — the kind that detect problems, plan a fix, take action, and check the result — without needing an expensive cloud setup. This will help me (and anyone following along) understand what’s really happening under the hood.

---

# Audience & Hook

**Who this is for:**  
- People curious about agentic AI in operations  
- Beginners who want to learn by building  
- Engineers who want a reproducible sandbox to play with self-healing patterns

**Why it’s different:**  
Most examples online either use full-scale cloud setups or toy-level code. This will be a middle ground — realistic enough to feel genuine, but simple enough to run locally and learn from.

# Initial Architecture (target for v1)

- **Node Agents:** Python scripts sending telemetry (CPU, network, storage)  
- **Control Plane:** FastAPI app receiving metrics and deciding actions  
- **Database:** PostgreSQL (Dockerized) to store incidents & metrics  
- **Failure Injection:** Scripts to trigger CPU spikes, network delays, storage lag  
- **OATS:** For generating varied test scenarios  
- **Optional LLM Meta-Agent:** Later, for reasoning/planning beyond fixed rules

---

# Constraints & Risks

- **Skills gap:** I’ll be learning Docker, APIs, and DB integration on the fly  
- **Complexity creep:** I must resist adding advanced features too early  
- **Realism vs simplicity:** Too simple feels fake, too complex overwhelms learning

# Learning Roadmap (Work in Progress)

- **Aug 9–10, 2025** — Set up PostgreSQL locally with Docker and connect to a test Python script.  
- **Aug 11–13, 2025** — Build a minimal Python node agent that sends CPU usage to a REST API.  
- **Aug 14–16, 2025** — Create a basic control plane (FastAPI) that detects and logs high CPU events.  
- **Aug 17–18, 2025** — Add simple failure simulation scripts (CPU spike, network delay, storage latency).  
- **Aug 19–20, 2025** — Run first full Detect → Plan → Act → Verify loop locally and record demo video.  
- **Aug 21–22, 2025** — Document runbook, architecture diagram, and key lessons learned.  
- **Aug 23–24, 2025** *(Stretch Goal)* — Integrate a basic LLM meta-agent for reasoning-driven remediation.

# Work-in-Progress Log

I’ll use this section as a running journal.  
Every entry will include:
- **Date**
- **Goal for the session**
- **What I tried**
- **What worked / failed**
- **What I learned**

# Evolution

- **2025-08-09:** Project conceived. Defined minimal scope and success criteria. Decided to document every step openly as I learn.
