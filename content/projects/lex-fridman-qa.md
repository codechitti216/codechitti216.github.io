# Lex Fridman Podcast QA System with HyDE + RAG

## Overview

Designed a QA system with BERT as the base embedding model using RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation), HyDE (Hypothetical Document Embeddings), Llama2-13B and OpenAI API for content fetching and generation.

## Key Achievements

- **Advanced RAG Implementation**: Combined traditional RAG with HyDE for improved retrieval
- **Fast Response Time**: ~3 seconds response time on RTX 3070
- **Production Ready**: Fully deployable system with Streamlit UI
- **Configurable**: User controls for various system parameters

## Technical Architecture

### Core Components
- **BERT Embeddings**: Base model for document and query encoding
- **HyDE Integration**: Hypothetical Document Embeddings for enhanced retrieval
- **RAG Pipeline**: Retrieval Augmented Generation for contextual responses
- **Llama2-13B**: Local language model for generation
- **OpenAI API**: Fallback and comparison generation

### System Design
- Modular architecture for easy maintenance
- Configurable parameters through UI
- Efficient indexing and retrieval system
- Real-time response generation

## Performance Metrics

- **Response Time**: ~3 seconds on RTX 3070
- **Accuracy**: High relevance in retrieved content
- **Scalability**: Handles large podcast corpus efficiently
- **User Experience**: Intuitive Streamlit interface
