# Visual Navigation Agent Debugging

## Overview

Diagnosed transformer-based failures in ViNT/GNM navigation agents, tracing planning errors to goal occlusion and unstable attention heads. This work contributed to understanding failure modes in state-of-the-art visual navigation systems.

## Key Findings

- **Failure Mode Analysis**: Identified specific failure patterns in ViNT/GNM agents
- **Root Cause**: Traced planning errors to goal occlusion and unstable attention heads
- **Transformer Issues**: Documented attention mechanism instabilities
- **Planning Errors**: Characterized relationship between visual occlusion and navigation failures

## Technical Analysis

### Problem Investigation
- Analyzed transformer-based visual navigation models
- Focused on ViNT (Visual Navigation Transformer) and GNM architectures
- Systematic debugging of planning failures

### Key Discoveries
- Goal occlusion significantly impacts navigation performance
- Attention heads show instability under certain visual conditions
- Planning errors correlate with specific visual patterns

### Methodology
- Systematic failure case analysis
- Attention visualization and analysis
- Performance correlation studies

## Technologies Used

- Visual Navigation Transformers (ViNT)
- Goal-conditioned Navigation Models (GNM)
- Attention mechanism analysis
- Deep learning debugging tools

## Impact

This debugging work provides valuable insights into the limitations of current visual navigation systems, particularly highlighting the vulnerability of transformer-based approaches to visual occlusion and attention instabilities. These findings inform future improvements in robust navigation system design.
